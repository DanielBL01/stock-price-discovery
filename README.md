# Stock Price Discovery

## Context
When dealing with stocks, there is a concept called “price discovery”, which is when breaking news comes in and stock 
prices react. As stockholders and investors, It’s important to process as much information as we can, not only of the
stocks that we own but also of other companies, their performances and metrics to possibly expand our portfolios to
make a profit.

However, it’s not reasonable to actively go out and search for this information in today’s day and age where
information is everywhere, which can be overwhelming.

Stock Price Discovery is built and intended to be a one-stop shop which runs multiple microservices to collect & ingest
data in real-time, provide summaries of articles for faster consumption of critical information and importantly,
gives users a clean, simplistic user interface which information can be easily categorized and labeled.
